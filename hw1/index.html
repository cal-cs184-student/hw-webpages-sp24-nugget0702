<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>In this homework, we discovered sampling and anti-aliasing techniques and implemented them to rasterize images. We also implemented transforms, baycentric coordinates, and texturing via mipmap.</p>

<h2 align="middle">Section I: Rasterization</h2>

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Rasterizing single-color triangles</h3>

<p>To rasterize triangles, we use 2-nested for-loops to iterate through our 2D pixel grid (min(x,y) x max(x,y)) outside our triangle. In the inner most for loop we 
  perform a conditional check to see whether a point is within the triangle formed by the 3-coordinates passed into 
  RasterizerImp::rasterize_triangle(). We also offset points by (+0.5, +0.5) to check the middle of the pixel. 
  Taking into account the winding order of the vertices, we checked both the clockwise and counterclockwise order of the triangle 
  by switching the order of the vertices when constructing the inside traiangle check. Finally, we call rasterize_point when we 
  have a point that is inside the traiangle thus, filling all pixels within the triangles with colors.</p>

<p>Our algorithm is no worse than one that checks each sample within the bounding box of the triangle because it does exactly that  </P>

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Antialiasing triangles</h3>

<p>Super sampling algorithm is very similar to Task 1 in that we use the 2-nested for-loops to iterate through our 2D pixel grid. 
  What does differ however, is the addition of another 2-nested for-loops to check our sqrt(sample_size) x sqrt(sample_size) grid 
  within each pixel. In the resolve_to_framebuffer function, we added code to iterate through each pixel and each of the subpixels to take 
  compute the avg color in the sqrt(sample_size) x sqrt(sample_size) grid, to assign to our supersampled pixel.
  Super sampling is useful as it allows us to obtain more detail by creating a high resolution version of our rasterized image and use this 
  to blur sharp lines and remove jaggies.

<h3 align="middle">Part 4: Barycentric coordinates</h3>

<p>
  In the case of a triangle, Barycentric cordinates are 3 coordinates, alpha, beta, and gamma, that specify the position
  of a point relative the triangle's vertices. It essentially describes the weight or influence each vertice has on a point in
  the triangle, thus the three coordinates add up to 1. This makes Barycentric coordinates ideal to interpolate since we are able to
  get the relative contribution of each vertice and blend values.

<h3 align="middle">Part 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</h3>
<p>Pixel sampling is the technique of going over the pixels of an image to modify or process them, 
  here we use it to perform texture mapping. For this task we incorporated four nested for loops, 
  the two outermost for loops keep track of the x and y coordinates of the pixels while the two 
  innermost for loops keep track of the x and y coordinate offsets to enable supersampling and keep 
  track of the pixel's centerpoints. Within the innermost for loop the barycentric coordinates are 
  calculated for the vertices of the (x, y) triangle passed into the function and the current point 
  we are on in the for loop. Then we check if the point lies inside the triangle by ensuring that the 
  barycentric coordinates are non-negative. We then calculate the (u, v) space coordinate using the 
  barycentric coordintes obtained from (x, y) triangle to scale it from (x, y) to (u, v). Based on 
  the pixel sampling method(psm) chosen the (u, v) coordinate is then either passed into sample_nearest() 
  or sample_bilinear(). Nearest sampling is essentially taking the mapped (u, v) coordinate and finding it's 
  nearest neighbor or closest pixel from the original image and matching its color/texture. While bilinear 
  pixel sampling takes into account the four nearest neighbor pixels and interpolates its color values 
  according to their respective distances from the sampling point and the point is then assigned to the 
  resulting color. Nearest sampling images tend to appear more jagged than bilinear sampled images. 
  The color value returned from either one of these functions is then passed into the rasterize_point 
  function along with its cooresponding (x, y) coordinate (with its offsets added on). This then results 
  in a texture mapped image.</p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 6: "Level sampling" with mipmaps for texture mapping</h3>
<p>Level sampling is a technique used in texture mapping where we store textures in 
  multiple resolutions(levels) with the lowest level consisting of the highest resolution and subsequent higher levels
decreasing in resolution by a factor of 2. For L_ZERO we assume that the level is 0 and sample from the full resolution of a texmap.
For L_NEAREST we take a float value as input for the desired level, and we output the average of the ceil() and floor() of the input 
level as the level of the texmap. And for L_LINEAR we take the weighted sum of the level above and below our desired level. When analyzing 
trade-offs between various techniques, increasing sample size per pixel increases memory and runtime efficiency, however this produces good
antialiasing. Sampling pixel using P_NEAREST is more efficient but still produces jaggies, while P_BILINEAR is less efficient and produces a 
better antialiased output. Increasing levels on level sampling can reduce the information we recieve from sampling, while decreasing levels can 
produce jaggies. Finding a middle ground for level sampling is best both for efficiency and desireable output. </p>
